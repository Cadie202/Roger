    <p style= "text-align: center">Welcome to the umtimate Roger Race! If you don't know Roger</p>
    <p style= "text-align: center">YOUR A LOSER!</p>
    <p>He's the fastest turtle throughout the known universe! Get your tickets before we run out. they're going fast so get your lazy butt over to the phone, pick it up, and call now!!!! You know you can't miss this, I mean come on it's a running turtle. Trust me people, I sell watches on the street for a living, these tickets are not going to last. there is no other event like this! you will get a seat face the wrong direction, overpriced/greasy food, and have to sit next to an overweight man on the phone! It's the best deal ever, so come on down to I'm not a serial killer Drive on June 23rd. You can even bring the kids. We have free glass ice cream and a bouncy house connected to a shady truck. All employee's at the event can assure you and your family are safe.</p>

Roger's race includes violence, dare devil jumps, and fire. Before anyone can attend we must have a contract signed and given to the entrance gaurds. there is a possibility of hardcore drugs and creepy people. this is not for the faint of heart, all people who attend have read our terms of service and have complied with them~</p>
